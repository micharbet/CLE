## `cle rcmove .dest`   -  move the environment files to $HOME/.dest/cle-name
##   This module has probably one-time use if you want to have the environment
##   installed in .config directory issue `cle rcmove .config`
##   Revert back to default directory with `cle rcmove ~`
##   You can safely remove it later using `cle mod del rcmove`
