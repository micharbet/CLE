## `lscreen [name]`    - gnu screen wrapper, join your recent session or start new
## `lscreen -j [name]` - join other screen sessions, ev. search by name
#: GNU screen wrapper is here 1) because of there was no way to tell screen
#: program to start CLE on more than first window and, 2) to allow easily
#: join detached own session and/or join cooperative session with more
#: participants.
lscreen () (
	#: get name of the screen to search and join
	#: base of session name is $CLE_USER and this can be extended
	NM=$CLE_USER${1:+-$1}
	[ "$1" = -j ] && NM=${2:-.}
	#: list all screens with that name and find how many of them are there
	SCRS=`screen -ls|sed -n "/$NM/s/^[ \t]*\([0-9]*\.[^ \t]*\)[ \t]*.*/\1/p"`
	NS=`wc -w <<<$SCRS`
	reset #: sometimes it's necessary to reset terminal
	if [ $NS = 0 ]; then
		[ "$1" = -j ] && echo "No screen to join" && return 1
		#: No session with given name found, prepare to start new session
		SCF=$CLE_D/screenrc
		SN=$CLE_TTY-CLE.$NM
		_clerh @ $CLE_TTY "screen -S $SN"
		# prepare own screenrc
		#: This generates nice configuration file with cool features:
		#:  - always visible status line with list of windows, hostname and clock
		#:  - feature to quickly switch using Ctrl+Left/Right Arrows
		#:  - reads good old $HOME/.screenrc
		#: Own screenrc file is necessary because otherwise it wouldn't start CLE in
		#: subsequent windows created with 'C-a C-c' (note the bind commands, above
		#: mentioned features are cool but this part is the important one)
