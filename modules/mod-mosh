	# Here is the issue: other wrappers use /var/tmp/$USER but mosh simply can't.
	# Preparation phase runs as 'server' code before start mosh-server. At this
	# point the $USER contains remote username.
	# On the other side, there's the command run by mosh itself but this code
	# is run locally and the remote username might not be known!
	# Temporary home must be defined outside mosh command.
